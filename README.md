## Overview

This repository is a **starter template** for developers who want to quickly spin up a weather‑forecast web app. It includes:

- A clean, component‑based UI built with **React** and **Next.js** App Router.
- Dynamic background effects (blinking stars) that stay visible behind content.
- Type‑safe code with **TypeScript**.
- Ready‑to‑use styling with modern CSS techniques (CSS variables, gradients, glass‑morphism).

---

## Features

- **Current weather** display (temperature, condition, location).
- **5‑day forecast** with icons and temperature ranges.
- **Responsive layout** – works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Animated starry background** that remains visible through transparent UI cards.
- **Easy API integration** – replace the placeholder fetch with any weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
